All three can be used\nindependently, but the components were designed to work together.\n\n| Shell UI component |                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Header             | The highest level of navigation.

To collapse the sub-menu, the user must again click the menu header\nin the left panel.\n\nThe left panel does not support three tiers of navigation.
