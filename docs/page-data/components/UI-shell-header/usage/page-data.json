All three can be used\nindependently, but the components were designed to work together.\n\n| Shell UI component |                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Header             | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels. |\n| Left panel         | An optional panel that is used for a product's navigation.                                                                              |\n| Right panel        | An optional panel that shows additional system level actions or content associated with a system icon in the header.                    |\n\n![UI shell components.](images/shell-usage-1.png)\n\n<Caption>UI shell components</Caption>\n\nFor each UI shell component, left-to-right translates to product-to-global. The\nleft side of the header contains items relevant at the product level. Moving to\nthe right along the header, the functions become more global. Elements in the\nmiddle of the header should represent system-level controls. Elements on the\nright side of the header, such as the switcher, are the most global in their\nscope and span multiple products.\n\n## Anatomy\n\nThe header spans the full width of the viewport and is the topmost element in\nthe browser window. Header elements are persistent throughout the product\nexperience.\n\n![Primary header](images/header-usage-2.png)\n\n<Caption>Primary header</Caption>\n\n### Header elements\n\n#### Hamburger menu\n\nThe hamburger icon is used to open product navigation such as the\n[left panel.](/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage)\n\n#### Header name\n\nFor IBM products, the header name is always preceded by “IBM”.\n\n#### Header links\n\nLinks in the header are supported as product navigation, if required. These\nlinks move to the side menu in narrow screen widths.\n\n#### Sub-menu\n\nSub-menus are supported as product navigation, if required. Include the\ndown-pointing chevron after the link label. Sub-menus open on click and are\nclosed by either selecting an item in the menu, clicking outside the menu area,\nor clicking on the menu label. When open, the chevron should point up. Sub-menu\nlabels serve only to open the dropdown; they cannot link to another page in the\nproduct.\n\n#### Header utilities\n\nThese utilities are reserved for universal, system-level functions such as\nprofile, search, notifications, and similar functions. Not every product on a\nsystem is required to show the same utilities, but it is recommended for a\nbetter cross-product user experience.\n\n#### Switcher\n\nThe switcher provides a way for the user to easily navigate _between_ products\nand systems. Recommended uses for this component include recently used apps,\nfrequently used apps, or all apps attached to the user’s account. If the list is\na manageable size, include all apps or products available on the system.\n\nLinks to related systems should also live in the switcher. If you’re building a\nproduct for IBM, your switcher should include a link to [IBM.](http://ibm.com/)\n\n## Icon placement\n\nIcons are not a required element of the header and a product may choose to use\nany set of icons for their UI. Icons should always be aligned to the right of\nthe header with no gaps between icons.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Header utilities are right aligned with no gaps\">\n\n![Example of header icons right aligned with no gaps.](images/header-usage-5.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Header utilities with a gap between the account and help icons.\">\n\n![Example of the header icons with a gap between the account and help icons.](images/header-usage-6.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Example placement\n\nThe example below shows a header with a switcher, three core icons, a product\nicon, and search.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![icon placement.](images/header-usage-4.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Icon          | Position                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Search        | Left                                   | Search should always be positioned as the furthest left icon. This is to allow for a expanding search field that does not disrupt other icon positions.                                                      |\n| Other         | Right of Search and left of core icons | The number of header icons a product uses may vary. This placement will help avoid disrupting the position of the core icons and inconsistencies as your user navigates between other product shell headers. |\n| Help          | 4th from the right                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Notifications | 3rd from the right                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Account       | 2nd from the right                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Switcher      | Right                                  | The switcher should always be positioned as the furthest right icon.
