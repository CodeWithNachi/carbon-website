Who works on Carbon? How can I contribute?\n  Here, we answer some of our frequently asked questions.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nWhat is the Carbon Design System?\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nCarbon is the open-source design system for all IBM software products. It is a\nseries of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating\nunified product experiences.\n\n### Who works on Carbon?\n\nCarbon has a [core team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/people) of\ndesigners and front-end developers dedicated to developing and supporting the\nsystem. Our core team sits in the IBM Design Studio in Austin, Texas. There are\nalso countless other designers and developers who contribute back to\n[carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components#contributors)\nand\n[carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react#contributors).\n\n### How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?\n\nCheck out our [contribution overview](/how-to-contribute/overview) to learn all\nabout the different ways to contribute. Thanks for the help!\n\n### Which browsers are supported?\n\nCarbon components are supported in the following browsers:\n\n- IE11\n- Microsoft Edge latest\n- Firefox latest\n- Chrome latest\n- Safari latest\n\n### What languages are the components written in?\n\nThere are four different implementations of the Carbon Design System. One is a\nvanilla JavaScript library; that's written in ES6+, SCSS, and HTML and ships\ndeliverables in vanilla JavaScript in ES5 as well as ES6, CSS, SCSS and HTML.\nAnother is a React library that ships a React rewrite of the JavaScript, but\nuses the same CSS as the core library. There are also Angular and Vue libraries\nthat use the same CSS.\n\n### I see a bug. How do I report it?\n\nFirst, make sure the problem is reproducible. Once confirmed, open an issue in\nthe appropriate GitHub repo (see below). We will address the bug as soon as we\ncan. If you have a fix for the bug, please feel free to submit a PR for it.\n\n#### Design issue repos\n\n- [Design kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues/new)\n- [Icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/issues/new)\n- [Website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new/choose)\n- [Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Elements](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n- [Everything else](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/issue-tracking/issues/new)\n\n#### Code repos\n\n- [carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/new)\n- [carbon-components-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/issues/new)\n- [carbon-charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n\n### What can I expect for a response to my bug report?\n\nIf you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make PR for the issue\nyourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as\npossible; sometimes within two or three days, but usually by the following\nsprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until they become a higher\npriority.\n\nTypical responses to bug reports will include:\n\n- Need more info, can't reproduce the problem\n- Won't fix, this isn't something we intend to support\n- Confirmed, will add to our roadmap (Carbon team will fix)\n- Confirmed, will accept PRs (need external member to fix)\n- Need to include design to verify this behavior is supported\n\n### What should I do if I find a component that isn't accessible?\n\nFirst, refer to the\n[Carbon accessibility guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) to confirm\nthat the component fails accessibility standards. If confirmed,\n[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\nin the Components repo and describe the steps to reproduce the problem. If the\ncore Carbon team confirms the problem, we will work to fix it as quickly as\npossible.\n\n### I haven't updated to the latest version of Carbon yet, and I still need the old documentation. Where can I find it?\n\nEvery version of Carbon that is still supported is hosted at its own domain. You\ncan find the old sites version here:\n**[V6](http://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V7](http://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V8](http://v8.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, and\n**[V9](http://v9.carbondesignsystem.com/).**\n\n### I'm an internal IBM team and want to know about COO status. Is there an approval on file?\n\nCarbon v10.x\n\n- COO record ID: 95607540\n- COO reference number: COO20190204\n- Name of IBM material (with version number): IBM Design System [Version 10,\n  Release n/a, Modification n/a]\n- Last release date: March 31, 2019\n- Name of Product/Program manager or author of material: Matt Rosno/US/IBM\n\nCarbon v9.x\n\n- COO number of IBM material (if any): AUS720180239\n- Name of IBM material (with version number): IBM Design System [Version 9,\n  Release n/a, Modification n/a]\n- Last release date: June 4, 2018\n- Name of Product/Program manager or author of material: Matt Rosno/US/IBM\n\n### Where do I find the Experimental components and patterns?\n\nThe patterns and components that were in Experimental are now in the Community\nsection. Community includes work developed and maintained by the individuals and\nteams who use Carbon. You can help elevate these resources by contributing\nfeedback, code, and design.\n\nNote that some of the content in Community is hosted on internal IBM sites and\nis only accessible to IBMers.\n\n### Where do I find charts and data visualization?\n\nCarbon charts are in development and classified as experimental. Check out the\n[experimental charts repo](https://carbon-design-system.github.io/carbon-charts/?experimental=true)\nto explore the work so far.\n\nThese charts will receive an updated color palette to match Carbon v10.
