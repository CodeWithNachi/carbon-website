It is maintained by a core\nteam of designers, developers, and writers based in the Austin, Texas IBM Design\nStudio.\n\nThe goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and quality,\nmaking the design and development process more efficient and focused,\nestablishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing\nclear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.\n\nThe design system is built [React](/get-started/develop/react) first. We also\nsupport core parts of the system in [vanilla JS](/get-started/develop/vanilla),\n[Angular](/get-started/develop/angular), and [Vue](/get-started/develop/vue). If\nyou’re using a different framework, you can still build components by following\nour guidelines for [other frameworks](/get-started/develop/other-frameworks).\n\n## Guiding principles\n\n**Carbon is open.** The design system is a distributed effort, guided by the\nprinciples of the\n[open source movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement).\nCarbon's users are also its makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\n\n**Carbon is inclusive.** It's designed and built to be accessible to all,\nregardless of ability or situation.\n\n**Carbon is modular and flexible.** The system's modularity ensures maximum\nflexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with\neach other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.\n\n**Carbon puts the user first.** Using rigorous research into users' needs and\ndesires, Carbon is laser-focused on real people.\n\n**Carbon builds consistency.** Based on the IBM Design Language, every element\nand component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly\ntogether to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.\n\n## How we work\n\nThe Carbon team encourages adoption through guidance and training, community\ndevelopment, maintenance, and support. The system is primarily maintained by a\ncore team and governed by an executive board of design advisors.\n\n### Adoption\n\n**We conduct training classes and offer certifications.** These cover\nintroductions to Carbon and participating in this community. Each program is\npiloted internally and available upon release externally. We teach at\nconferences, bootcamp labs, and wherever else we're needed.\n\n**We engage the community.** We strive to be one of the world’s best design\nsystems and we’re always\n[open to feedback](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=).\nWe communicate with you about Carbon's state and roadmap through GitHub support,\nblog posts, and Twitter.\n\n**Contributed components and patterns include a list of maintainers.** The\nCarbon team triages and supports maintenance requests that do not have a\nmaintainer. Unmaintained patterns will be demoted to Experimental if the Carbon\nteam decides not to maintain them.\n\n**We provide support for users of the design system.** The Carbon team engages\nwith users primarily through GitHub.
