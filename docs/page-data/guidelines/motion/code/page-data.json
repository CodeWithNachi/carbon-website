You can access these curves using\neither Sass or JavaScript.\n\n### Sass\n\n`@carbon/motion` exports a `carbon--motion` function and `carbon--motion` mixin\nthat you can use to access the value of a motion curve or include that curve as\nthe `transition-timing-function` for a selector. To use these helpers, you can\ndo the following in your project:\n\n```scss\n@import '@carbon/motion/scss/motion.scss';\n\n.my-custom-selector {\n  // Supplies the standard easing curve, using the productive mode by default\n  transition-timing-function: carbon--motion(standard);\n}\n\n.my-custom-selector-v2 {\n  // Supplies the standard easing curve, but with the expressive mode, on the\n  // transition-timing-function property for this selector\n  @include carbon--motion(standard, expressive);\n}\n```\n\nBoth the `motion` function and mixin support passing in the name of the motion\ncurve and the mode you want to work in.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nIf you're using `@carbon/motion` as a JavaScript dependency, we export our\neasings and a function called `motion` that you can use. For example:\n\n```js\n// CommonJS\nconst { easings, motion } = require('@carbon/motion');\n```\n\nYou can also include this as a JavaScript module:\n\n```js\n// ESM\nimport { easings, motion } from '@carbon/motion';\n\nmotion('standard', 'productive'); // Returns a string `cubic-bezier()` function\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM motion generator\"\n      href=\"https://ibm.github.io/motion/\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"41a630288be15b59f1b446879d1f1697","counter":2823,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Motion","description":"Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.","tabs":["Overview","Choreography","Code"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Motion\ndescription:\n  Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences,\n  and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to\n  finish—and make progress.\ntabs: ['Overview', 'Choreography', 'Code']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe Carbon motion package empowers consistent cadence and movement of elements\nacross digital experiences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nIf you’re using carbon-components there’s no reason to install the motion\npackage separately.
